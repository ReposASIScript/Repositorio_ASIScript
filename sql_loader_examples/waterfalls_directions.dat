"To get to Tannery Falls, take Munising Avenue east out of
downtown Munising. Going east, Munising Avenue is the same
as H-58. You don't have to go far. Look for the the intersection
where Washington Street goes off to your left. Washington Street
takes you towards the hospital and the Munising Falls Visitor Center.
On your right, just before you get to Washington Street, you'll see a
stairway leading from the roadside up into the woods. You should see a
bridge as well, but the stairway is closer to town, and it's the stairway
that leads to these falls."
***
"Take M-28 west out of Munising. Drive through Christmas,
and begin watching for the Scott Falls Roadside Park on
your right. The falls are directly across the road
from the park, but you won't be able to see them when you
approach from the east."
***
"Drive 22 miles north-east of Munising via H-58 to a dirt road.
Turn north, and take the dirt road to the trailhead. After that
it's a 1.3 mile hike to the falls themselves."
