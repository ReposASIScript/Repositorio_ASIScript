Alger,"Scott Falls","Dcp_1422.jpg","Scott Falls is a small, but very picturesque
waterfall that's easily seen from the road. It's easily seen
that is, as you travel east on M-28 out of Au Train. While
only 20-30 feet from the road, the falls face west. If you're
traveling west, you'll miss them unless you happen to look
in your rearview mirror at just the right moment. What you
won't miss is the Scott Falls Roadside Park—a scenic picnic
area on the shore of Lake Superior just across the road from
the falls.","scott_dir","scott_falls.shtml"
